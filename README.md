title: Resume Analyzer (ML + NLP)
---

An AI-powered Resume Analyzer built using Machine Learning (ML) and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate resume screening, parsing,
and job recommendation. This web-based application helps recruiters and
job seekers by reducing manual effort, eliminating bias, and improving
accuracy in the hiring process.

# üöÄ Features

-   Automated Resume Classification -- Classifies resumes into
    categories like Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Marketing Manager
    using ML models.

-   Resume Parsing -- Extracts Name, Contact, Skills, Education, and
    Work Experience.

-   Job Recommendation Engine -- Suggests best-matching job roles based
    on extracted features.

-   NLP Integration -- Uses TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Count Vectorizer for
    feature extraction.

-   Machine Learning Models -- Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree,
    Logistic Regression, AdaBoost.

-   Web Application (Flask) -- User-friendly interface to upload
    resumes, view results, and manage authentication.

-   Authentication System -- User Signup/Login (MySQL-based) and Admin
    login support.

-   Bias-Free & Scalable -- Processes large datasets quickly and
    provides objective recommendations.
